# Thermostability assay: β-glucosidase B

This procedure assumes that you followed the protein production and
purification procedure in this folder.  

## Materials

Material | Concentration | Amount per sample
---------|---------------|------------------
Purified protein | about 1 mg/mL | 14 µL
Protein Buffer | | ~7.4 mL
2 mL tube | | 1 
pNPG solution | 0.1 M | 800 µL
15 mL Falcon tube | | 1 
assay plate | | 1 
PCR plate | | 1 

+ Repeater pipet 
+ Multichannel pipet
+ Thermocycler 
+ Plate reader 

## Method

1. Mix 70 µL of the purified protein and 1330 µL of protein buffer in a 2 mL tube to create 20X diluted protein
2. Mix 800 µL of substrate solution and 7.2 mL of protein buffer in a 15 mL Falcon tube
3. Use a repeater to transfer 75 µL of diluted substrate into each well of the assay plate
4. Aliquot 50 µL of diluted protein solution into each well of the PCR plate. Use three columns per mutant. 
5. Theromocycle the PCR plate for 30 min with a gradient from 30 C to 50 C (saved program BGLGRAD) 
6. Using a multichannel, transfer 25 µL of each well of the PCR plate to the corresponding well in the assay plate
7. Monitor absorbance at 420 nm for 60 min using the plate reader
8. Record the sample name, temperature, and rate observed for each well
