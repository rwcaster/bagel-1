##### Hardware:
+ Pipettor and tips (2, 20, and 200 μL)
+ 37° C incubator
+ Ice
+ Ice bucket
+ 42° C dry bath

### Method

1. Set tubes and chemical competent cells on ice 
1. In an ice cold 2 mL tube, mix plasmid and competent cells
1. Incubate on ice for 10 minutes 
1. Incubate at 42 C for 30 seconds 
1. Incubate on ice for 5 minutes
1. Add 200 µL media and recover at 37 C for 1 hour
1. Pipet 200 µL recovered cells on to plate, add glass beads, shake, and get rid of beads
1. Incubate plate upside down overnight at 37 C

## Growth cultures

### Materials

### Method 

1. Add kanamycin to Terrific Broth to make a batch of growth media for all of your mutants 
1. Aliquot 5 mL growth media into each in each Falcon tube 
1. Using a pipettor, carefully scrape a single colony off of the plate, dip in the growth media in the Falcon tube, and pipet up and down a few times to inoculate the tube
1. Seal tubes with tube seals
1. Incubate with shaking at 37 C for 24 hours

## Expression cultures 

### Materials 

Material | Concentration | Amount per reaction
---------|---------------|-----------------------------
Growth cultures from day 2 | | 1
TB (Terrific Broth) | | 5 mL
1M IPTG | 1000X | 5 μL
Kanamycin | 1000X | 5 μL
MgSO<sub>4</sub> | 1000X | 5 μL
Pre-cut tube seal | | 1

##### Hardware:
+ Tube rack
+ Vortexer
+ Centrifuge
+ Pipettor (20 μL)
+ Serological pipette and tip
+ Shaking incubator at 18° C

### Method 

1. Centrifuge growth cultures at 4,700 RPM for 10 minutes, unseal, and pour away supernatant from the pellets 
1. Weigh the pellet and record your pellet weight 
1. Make a batch of induction medium by adding IPTG and kanamycin to enough TB for all your cultures
1. Add 1 mL induction medium to cell pellet in tube 
1. Vortex to resuspend pellet
1. Add 4 mL more induction medium to tube
1. Seal with tube seals
1. Incubate with shaking at 18° C for 24 hours 

## Protein purification 

### Materials

Material | Concentration | Amount per reaction
---------|---------------|-----------------------------
Expression culture from day 3 | | 5 mL
Wash Buffer (for lysis buffer) | | 450 μL
Wash Buffer (for resuspension) | | 500 μL
Wash Buffer (for washing) | | 3.5 mL
Bugbuster | 10X | 50 μL
Dry lysis mix | | 1 mg
2 mL microcentrifuge tube | | 1
Protein buffer | | 200 μL
Nickel-NTA resin | | 100 μL

##### Hardware:
+ Centrifuge capable of 4700-14000 rpm
+ Tube rack
+ Rocker
+ Waste collector
+ Protein microcolumns
+ Pipettors and tips (20, 200, and 1000 μL)
+ Spectrophotometer
+ SDS-PAGE equipment

### Method 

1. Centrifuge expression cultures at 4,700 RPM for 10 minutes, unseal, and pour away supernatant
1. Resuspend cell pellet in 500 µL wash buffer and transfer 1 mL to Goog tube
1. Make lysis buffer by mixing BugBuster, wash buffer, and lysis mix in a Falcon tube
1. Aliquot 500 µL lysis buffer into resuspended pellets in 2 mL tubes
1. Rock tubes for 20 minutes 
1. Centrifuge at 14,700 RPM for 10 minutes 
1. While centrifuging, set microcolumns in rack over waste collector 
1. Add 100uL of nickel resin (blue) from 50% slurry to each microcolumn
1. Add 500 µL of wash buffer and allow to drip through
1. Once the lysed cultures have finished spinning, add 500 µL of clarified supernatant and allow to drip through so the column is mostly empty 
1. Add another 500 µL of supernatant and allow to drip through  
1. Wash six times with 500 µL of wash buffer, allow to drip through each time, nice to have a repeater for this 
1. Once all unwanted proteins have been washed away, transfer column to fresh tube
1. Add 100 µL protein buffer directly to beads and incubate at room temperature for five minutes 
1. Add second 100 µL protein buffer and pulse in the centrifuge a couple of times to ensure you get all the liquid
1. Wash out the columns and store your protein at 4° C
