1.  Mix 1 μL expression plasmid and 20 μL competent cells and let incubate on ice for 10 minutes
1.  Incubate mix in dry bath at 42 &deg;C for 60 seconds
1.  Incubate mix on ice for 60 seconds
1.  Add 200 μL TB media and recover cells at 37 &deg;C for 1 hour
1.  Pipet 220 μL recovered cells onto a plate labeled with its mutant name on the agarose half of the plate; add 8-10 glass beads; shake to evenly spread culture; then remove beads and place in a bleach-filled container for later cleaning and reuse 
1.  Incubate plate upside-down (agarose side on top) overnight at 37 &deg;C

###Tips and Tricks
+  Keep cells cold and work quickly! These cells are very sensitive to temperature change and shaking

1.  These plates can be sealed with parafilm and stored at 4 &deg;C for up to one month

###Tips and Tricks

+ Make enough stock solution for N + 1 reactions to make sure you have enough for the last tube!


## Expression cultures 

### Materials 

### Method 

1.  Centrifuge growth cultures at 4700 RPM for 10 minutes to pellet cells
1.  Remove seal and decant supernatant
1.  Combine IPTG, kanamycin, MgSO<sub>4</sub>, and terrific broth to make “induction medium”
1.  Add 5 mL of induction medium, cap the tube, and vortex to resuspend cell pellet 
1.  Dicard the lid and seal tubes with fresh tube seals
1.  Incubate with shaking at 18 °C for 24 hours

###Tips and Tricks

+ Make enough stock solution for N + 1 reactions to make sure you have enough for the last tube!


## Protein purification 

### Materials

### Method 

1.  Centrifuge expression culture at 4700 RPM for 10 minutes to pellet cell and decant supernatant
1.  Resuspend cell pellet in 500 μL wash buffer; transfer 1 mL of resuspension to a labeled 2 mL microcentrifuge tube
1.  Combine Bugbuster, wash buffer, and dry lysis mix to produce lysis buffer
1.  Aliquot 500 μL lysis buffer into the 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes containing the resuspended cells
1.  Rock tubes for 20 minutes
1.  Centrifuge tubes at 14000 RPM for 10 minutes
1.  Set protein microcolumns in a labeled tube rack over a waste collector
1.  Add 100 μL of nickel slurry to each microcolumn
1.  Add 500 μL of wash buffer to microcolumn; allow to drip through
1.  Add 500 μL of supernatant to microcolumn; allow to drip through
1.  Add another 500 μL of supernatant to microcolumn; allow to drip through
1.  Wash microcolumn with 500 μL wash buffer six times; allow to drip through each time
1.  Transfer protein microcolumn into fresh, labeled microcentrifuge tube
1.  Add 100 μL protein buffer directly to nickel beads in protein microcolumn in fresh tube; incubate at room temperature for five minutes
1.  Add another 100 μL protein buffer to beads, then centrifuge briefly at 4000 RPM to collect all flow-through
1.  Determine protein yields using absorbance at 280 nm on the spectrophotometer and run an SDS-PAGE
1.  Store protein at 4 C for up to 72 hours.

###Tips and Tricks

+  After centerfuging and decanting you can freeze the cell pellet by placing an airtight lid on the Falcon tube and storing at -20 &deg;C
+  Make enough lysis buffer for N + 1 reactions to make sure you have enough for all your cells!
+  Mix very gently to avoid excessive frothing
+  Avoid getting nickel resin on the sides of the column
+  Ensure slurry is homogenous before pipetting into column!
+  The slurry can clog your pipette. Make sure to use big pipette tips
+  Keep the microcolumn/nickel resin from becoming completely dry
+  After the short centrifugation to elute protein the 200 μL contains your purified protein.


###Methods

1.  Protein activity test: mix 90 μL substrate stock and 10 μL purified protein in labeled 2 mL tube

  +  If this turns yellow within five minutes: make 1/100 dilutions of protein
    +  Add 10 μL purified protein to 990 μL wash buffer in labeled microcentrifuge  tube

  +  If this doesn’t turn yellow within five minutes: make 1/10 dilutions of protein
    +  Add 100 μL purified protein to 900 μL wash buffer in labeled microcentrifuge  tube
 
1.  Aliquot 25 μL of diluted protein solution into each well of a non-binding white plate. Use three columns per mutant, with four mutant types per plate.
1.  In substrate plate, dispense 150 μL of substrate stock into the first row and 112.5 μL of protein buffer into the rest of the rows
1.  Remove 37.5 μL from the first row, pipette into the second row, and mix by pipetting up and down
1.  Repeat this serial dilution until you have reached the second to last row. Remove the 37.5 uL from the second to last row, but do not add it to the last row (the last is a control without substrate). Make sure every well has 112.5 μL volume.
1.  Set up your plate reader to read every well on the plate at 420 nm every minute for 60 minutes, and calculate the resultant rate
1.  Transfer 75 μL substrate with the multichannel pipettor from substrate plate to assay plate to initiate reaction (The extra substrate left in the cheap plate is to ensure that you are able to transfer a full 75 uL.)
1.  Have your computer ready and plate reader open to read the plate for 1 hour. Analyze results.

###Tips and Tricks
+  If the white protein plate is set up correctly, each mutant will take up a 3X8 rectangle of wells
+  Transfer the control first (the bottom row) and work your way up the assay plate. Work quickly because once the substrate is added, the reaction will begin. The lower concentrations of substrate do not react as quickly as the higher concentrations.
